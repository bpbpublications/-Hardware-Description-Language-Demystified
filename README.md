## About the Book
Hardware Description Language (HDL) allows analysis and simulation of digital logic and circuits. The HDL is an integral part of the EDA (electronic design automation) tool for PLDs, microprocessors, and ASICs. So, HDL is used to describe a Digital System. The combinational and sequential logic circuits can be described easily using HDL. Verilog HDL, standardized as IEEE 1364, is a hardware description language used to model electronic systems. 

This book is a comprehensive guide about the digital system and its design using various VLSI design tools as well as Verilog HDL. The step-wise procedure to use various VLSI tools such as Xilinx, Vivado, Cadence NC-SIM, is covered in this book. It also explains the advanced concept such as User Define Primitives (UDP), switch level modeling, reconfigurable computing, etc. Finally, this book ends with FPGA based prototyping of the digital system. 

By the end of this book, you will understand everything related to digital system design.
